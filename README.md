# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project
This project was completed by Rafael Olivares Ruiz in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Spring 2018. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have: Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing thereof– has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography. And I understand that: Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden. I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.

Project Description In this project I analyze the Medicare drug spending data for the years 2011-2015. In particular, I am concerned with the following questions:

Does beneficiary count determine price level?
Are more common medications more or less volatile than the ones with less beneficiaries?
Does the U.S. Federal budget suffer from medications with large volumes that are also volatile? To answer this, I use the data and plot several graphs that attempt to answer the question.
